<h3>War of Transgression:</h3>

<p>In order to maintain Cocoon, it had to steal resources from Gran Pulse. The people of Gran Pulse came to see Cocoon as a place of evil while the citizens of Cocoon were led to believe that Gran Pulse was a barbaric, dangerous place that should be feared. The Pulse fal'Cie Anima finally decided to go to war against Cocoon.</p>

<p>Anima made two humans from the village of Oerba l'Cie in order to attack Cocoon. They were meant to become the beast Ragnarok and destroy Cocoon. Vanille couldn't go through with it and Fang became an incomplete Ragnarok, only able to dent the outer shell of Cocoon. Fang and Vanille were turned into crystal afterward.</p>
