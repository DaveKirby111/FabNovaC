<p>In the beginning there was the creator Mwynn who was killed by her son Bhunivelze to gain control of the Mortal Realm. When she died, Mwynn was sent to the Unseen Realm where all souls go. Bhunivelze believed that Mwynn had cursed the world with mortality and so he created three beings (fal'Cie) to carry out specific tasks. Bhunivelze could not get to the Unseen Realm without giving up control of the Mortal Realm, so he created Pulse to search for the door. Next he created Etro, who looked too much like Mwynn and so she was discarded with no power or a task to complete. Lastly he created Lindzei to watch over him as he slept, and awaken him when Pulse found the door to the Unseen Realm.</p>

<p>Etro ended up in Valhalla, a place outside of time and where souls pass through to the Unseen Realm. In an effort to gain Bhunivelze's favor, Etro killed herself. Lindzei then used Etro's blood to create humanity. Etro met Mwynn in the Unseen Realm, who was being consumed by chaos. Mwynn tasked Etro with watching over the balance of souls passing into the Unseen Realm, or the universe would collapse.</p>

<p>Pulse and Lindzei created other fal'Cie to act as their servants in the Mortal Realm. Lindzei created a floating continent known as Cocoon to shield humanity from the dangerous world of Gran Pulse below. Some humans chose to live on Cocoon while others remained on Gran Pulse. Eventually, Pulse and Lindzei vanished and over time humans came to see the fal'Cie as gods. Even though Cocoon is a "paradise" for humanity, the true purpose is to cultivate humans like a farm so that eventually the fal'Cie can sacrifice the humans to bring back the maker.</p>
